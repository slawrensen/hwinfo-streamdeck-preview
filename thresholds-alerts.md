title: Thresholds & Alerts
nav_order: 7

Thresholds turn a key (or dial bar) into a warning light. Set a **Warn at** and/or **Critical at** value, and the plugin colors the reading the moment its live value crosses the limit: amber for warn, red for critical.

Both fields are optional and independent: set one, the other, or neither. A key with no thresholds just shows its themed value.

## The two fields

| Field | Effect on a **key** | Effect on a **dial** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Warn at** | Whole face flips to amber field / black text | Range bar fill turns amber (single view), or the alerting row's value (overview views) |
| **Critical at** | Whole face flips to red field / white text | Range bar fill turns red (single view), or the alerting row's value (overview views) |
| **Direction** (*Alert when value drops below thresholds*) | Flips the comparison so a *low* value is the alarm | Same |

On a key the alert takes over the entire face; this is deliberate, aviation-style master caution/warning that reads across a whole wall of keys. On a Stream Deck + dial the touchscreen slot is too small for a full flip, so on the single view only the range bar's fill changes color and the label, value and range text stay themed. The two-row and three-row overview views draw no range bar, so there the alerting row's own value turns amber or red and the rest of the face stays themed. See [Sensor Dial](sensor-dial.md) for the rest of the dial.

Thresholds have a second, quieter effect on any face that draws a range. A key whose **Display** is set to **Bar** or **Ring** (a one-reading-layout setting) marks the same limits on its track: muted amber from **Warn at** and muted red from **Critical at**, running toward the alarmed end, the low end when *Direction* alerts below. The dial's range bar marks them the same way. The zones are blended toward the face background so the live fill always reads over them, and a key's range, which is always automatic, widens just enough to keep a zone visible. A dial pinned with **Bar min** / **Bar max** is never widened; a zone outside those bounds is clipped. See [Display: sparkline, bar, ring](sensor-reading.md#display-sparkline-bar-ring).

## How the comparison works

Two rules matter, and both are easy to get wrong:

**1. Thresholds are in the *displayed* unit.** The value compared against your thresholds is the **live (current) reading in whatever unit the key shows**, after the °C→°F conversion, not before. So if you tick *Show temperatures in °F*, a **Warn at** of `100` fires on a 40 °C core (which displays as 104 °F). Leave °F off and the same sensor is compared in °C. Match your numbers to the unit on the face. One exception: the deck-wide **Data units** setting re-tiers byte and rate readings for display only. Thresholds still compare against the number HWiNFO reports, so a `12345.6 MB` reading is compared as `12345.6` while the key shows `12.3 GB`, and a `12000000 B/s` reading is compared as `12000000` while the key shows `96.0 Mbps`. Switching Decimal to Binary never re-arms an alert. See [Data units](sensor-reading.md#advanced-deck-wide).

> **Note:** Alert color always tracks the *live* value, even when the key is showing MIN / MAX / AVG (press cycles the stat mode). Pressing a key to look at its max won't turn the alert off if the current value is still over the limit, and won't turn it on just because the historical max was.

**2. The trigger is "at or past" the limit.** Crossing means reaching the value, not exceeding it:

- Normal direction (higher is worse): alerts when `value ≥ threshold`.
- Below direction (lower is worse): alerts when `value ≤ threshold`.

Critical is checked before warn, so once a reading is past both limits it shows critical.

### Decimal commas are accepted

Both fields accept a period *or* a comma as the decimal separator, so `70.5` and `70,5` both mean seventy-and-a-half. Blank means "no threshold". Anything that isn't a number is ignored (treated as no threshold).

## Direction: alert when high vs. alert when low

By default higher is worse, the right setting for temperatures, power draw, and usage. Tick **Alert when value drops below thresholds** for readings where *low* is the problem:

- **Fan RPM**: a stalled or dying fan reads *low*.
- **Free disk space**: you want to know when it drops *under* a floor.
- **Battery %**, available memory, and similar "headroom" readings.

With the box ticked, your **Warn at** / **Critical at** values become floors: the alert fires when the reading falls to or below them.

## Colors are global and colorblind-safe

The warn and critical palettes are **never themed**. Amber-warn and red-crit look identical on Void, Paper, Ember, or any other [theme](themes.md): an alert must be unmistakable regardless of the surrounding look. The two states are separated by luminance as well as hue (bright amber field vs. deep red field), so they stay distinguishable under any color-vision deficiency. Type accents don't apply to an alerting key either; the alert owns the whole palette.

## Worked examples

### CPU temperature: warn 80, crit 90

A typical desktop-CPU key in °C:

- **Warn at** `80`
- **Critical at** `90`
- **Direction**: leave unticked (higher is worse)

Idle and under load the key stays themed. At 80 °C it goes amber; at 90 °C it goes red. If you'd rather read the face in Fahrenheit, tick *Show temperatures in °F* **and** enter the thresholds in °F (e.g. `176` / `194`); the numbers must match the displayed unit.

![HWiNFO Sensors on a Stream Deck: seven display themes across the top row (Void, Graphite, Ultraviolet, Midnight, Forest, Ember, Paper), each key showing a live value, unit and sparkline; below them the aviation-style amber warn and red critical alert states; then a row showing what one key can hold (two, three and four readings, and the Bar and Ring gauges); and four Stream Deck + touchscreen faces at their true relative size, including both multi-row overviews.]({{ '/assets/img/themes-contact-sheet.png' | relative_url }})

### Fan RPM: alert when it drops

A fan you want to catch stalling:

- **Warn at** `500`
- **Critical at** `300`
- **Direction**: **ticked** (alert when below)

Above 500 RPM the key is normal; at 500 or under it warns; at 300 or under it goes critical (0 RPM = a stopped fan = red).

### Free disk space: alert on a low floor

Free space in GB, so you notice before a drive fills:

- **Warn at** `50`
- **Critical at** `20`
- **Direction**: **ticked** (alert when below)

Drops to 50 GB → amber; drops to 20 GB → red.

> **Tip:** When you use the *below* direction, set **Critical at** *lower* than **Warn at** (crit is the worse, deeper floor). Because critical is evaluated first, an inverted pair (e.g. warn 300, crit 500 with below on) makes the reading go straight to critical without ever showing warn.

## Where thresholds live

The **Warn at**, **Critical at** and **Direction** controls are on both the Sensor Reading (key) and Sensor Dial property inspectors, just below the display options. There is one pair of limits per key and per dial, and they persist with the rest of that button's [settings](sensor-reading.md).

On the **Two readings, stacked**, **Three readings, rows** and **Four readings, quad grid** key layouts that one pair watches the **first** sensor only: the other rows or cells never raise an alert of their own, and the whole key recolors when the first sensor crosses. Put the reading you want alerts on first, or give it its own key.

On a **dial**, thresholds and the manual bar range are additionally **unit-scoped**: rotation can put readings with different units on the same dial, so a threshold applies only to readings in the unit it was typed against (a °C warn level can never fire on a fan RPM you rotate to). Details on [Dial controls & presets](controls.md#thresholds-and-mixed-units).
