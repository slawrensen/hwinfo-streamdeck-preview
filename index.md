  Live HWiNFO sensor readings on your Elgato Stream Deck.
---

**HWiNFO Sensors** puts temperatures, clocks, fan speeds, usage and power on
your Stream Deck. It reads HWiNFO locally. Windows 10+ x64, free, MIT licensed,
no ads, no telemetry.

![Seven themes, alert states, multi-reading keys and dial views.]({{ '/assets/img/themes-contact-sheet.png' | relative_url }})

*Production renderers with sample readings and generated histories. This is
a layout comparison, not a hardware photograph.*

> **1.7** redesigns the settings panels, adds per-reading dial colors and
> changes how sources, identities and history are handled.
> [See what changed for you](whats-new-1.7.md).

## What it does

- **Keys:** one to four readings, custom labels, current or historical values,
  and a sparkline, bar or ring on single-reading keys.
- **Dials:** a single reading or a two- or three-row overview. Rotate through
  readings, use named groups or enable auto-cycle. Local session statistics
  record accepted observations.
- **Colors:** seven themes, per-action or shared text settings, and
  individual reading colors on multi-row dials in 1.7. Alerts take priority.
- **Details:** press a key to open a page for its source, a custom list or a
  filter. Return with the Back tile.
- **Controls:** drive dials from a key or Multi Action. Switch readings,
  pause auto-cycle, pin a reading or reset local statistics.

Shared Memory supplies current values and HWiNFO's MIN/MAX/AVG. Gadget is a
current-value fallback with limited freshness evidence. Saved readings need
[explicit links](data-sources.md#link-readings-across-providers) to work across
the two sources. Read the [source guide](data-sources.md) before relying on
fallback.

## Start here

1. [Install the plugin](installation.md) and enable sharing in HWiNFO.
2. [Add your first reading](getting-started.md) and set its label and alerts.
